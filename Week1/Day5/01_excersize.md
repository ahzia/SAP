## 🎯 Activity 1: What is Robotics? - Your First Thoughts

### Before We Start

**When you hear "Robotics," what do you think of?**
- [ ] Physical robots
- [ ] Factory robots
- [ ] Robot vacuum cleaners
- [ ] Something complicated
- [ ] Other: ___________________________________________

**Your definition of robotics:**

## 💡 Activity 2: Simple Robotics Explanation

### What is Robotics?

**Definition:** Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.

**What does this mean?**
- **Design and construction** = Making robots
- **Operation and use** = Using robots
- **Autonomously** = By themselves, without human help
- **Semi-autonomously** = Mostly by themselves, with some human help

**Simple Explanation:**
Robotics = Making and using robots that can do tasks by themselves!

**Examples:**
- Robot vacuum cleaner
- Factory assembly robots
- Medical surgery robots
- Delivery robots

## 🎨 Activity 3: Difference Between Robotics, Automation, and AI

### Understanding the Three Concepts

**ROBOTICS:**
- **Focus:** Physical robots performing tasks
- **Example:** 
  > ___________________________________________

**AUTOMATION:**
- **Focus:** Can involve both software (RPA) and hardware automation, not necessarily robots
- **Example:** 
  > ___________________________________________

**AI:**
- **Focus:** Intelligence and decision-making capabilities applied to various fields, including robotics
- **Example:** 
  > ___________________________________________

**Fill in the table:**

| Feature | Robotics | Automation | AI |
|---------|----------|------------|-----|
| **Physical robot?** | | | |
| **Can be software?** | | | |
| **Makes decisions?** | | | |
| **Example** | | | |

**How are they related?**

## 🧩 Activity 4: What is Automation?

### Simple Explanation

**Definition:** Automation involves using technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention.

**What does this mean?**
- **Using technology** = Computers, software, robots
- **Perform tasks** = Do work
- **Minimal human intervention** = Little or no human help needed

**Simple Example:**
- **Manual:** You wake up, walk to coffee maker, press button, wait
- **Automated:** Coffee maker starts at 7 AM automatically

**Another Example:**
- **Manual:** You check email every hour
- **Automated:** Email app checks for you and notifies you

**Can you think of another example?**
