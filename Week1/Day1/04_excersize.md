## 💡 Activity 2: Simple Blockchain Explanation

### What is Blockchain?

**Blockchain = A Decentralized Digital Ledger**

**Simple Explanation:**
- **Decentralized** = Not stored in one place (many computers have copies)
- **Digital Ledger** = Digital record book
- **Cannot be altered retroactively** = Can't change past records

**Simple Example:**
Imagine a notebook where:
- Every page is connected to the page before it
- Once you write something, you can't erase it
- Everyone has a copy, so no one can cheat
- If someone tries to change their copy, everyone else knows

**That's blockchain!**
